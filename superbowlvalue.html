      <h1><strong>The Value</strong><h1>
      <h3>Viewers</h3>
      <p> Although the <a href="https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/super-bowl-draws-average-audience-106m-viewers-171563" id="link">viewing</a> of the Super Bowl fluctuates throughout the years,
        the number of viewers usually lingers around 100 Million. This makes it
        the most watched thing on television every year (In the USA). The publicity
        that the Super Bowl attracts is absurd, which makes the amount of money
        that it takes in also enormous. </p>
      <h3>Ticket Prices</h3>
      <p>The amount of money it costs to purchase a ticket might just be a literal
        arm and a leg. The next Super Bowl, Super Bowl LIII, has its tickets
        starting at $5000. That is an insane price, considering that the tickets
        for a normal, regular season game are around $150. These Super Bowl
        tickets don't last long either. They are bought by resellers and sold
        for inhumane prices. A good explanation for the inflated price of these
        tickets is that only a fraction of people who go are not in the 1%. Most
        of the people that attend Super Bowls are in large companies that go
        and advertise. Also, you will find many celebrities there, too. </p>
        <h3>Commercials</h3>
        <p>Commercials are the reason that so many people watch the Super Bowl.
          A good portion of the 100 million who are tuning in are only there for
          the commercials, and in reality they probably do not even understand
          the sport. Companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, GoDaddy, and MnMs make
          frequent appearances in the Big Game to attract customers. The average
          price to have a commercial play during the Big Game is around four and
          a half million dollars for just a 30-second showing. The price of these
          commercials not only gives the NFL loads of money, but is probably one
          of the most high-risk high-reward decisions a company can make.</p>

          <h3>Halftime Show</h3>
          <p>The Super Bowl Halftime Show is another huge reason why the event
            gets so many views on television. Basically, every Super Bowl has a
            performer that it appointed to it. The main performer may also have
            some side performers that feature. The Halftime Show is like an
            elaborate, 30-minute concert during halftime. Artists who have run
            the show include Beyonce, Bruno Mars, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Michael
            Jackson, and many more. </p>
